# Introduction

Julia code for a Empirical Finance course at UNISG. 

See also my FinancialEconometrics repository for Julia notebooks on OLS, MLE, GARCH, Kernel regressions, Monte Carlos, Bootstraps and panel regressions.

The current version is tested on Julia 1.1.

The .ipynb files are Julia notebooks. They use data in the Data folder and Julia functions in the jlFiles folder. The notebooks are meant to be used together with my lecture notes (the pdf file).


# Instructions

If you just want to see a notebook, click on it.  Sometimes it renders better if you activate the nbviewer (see the symbol in the upper right corner once you have opened the file).

You use IJulia to edit and run these Julia notebooks. You can either install Julia/IJulia on your local computer (see https://sites.google.com/site/paulsoderlindecon/home/software for instructions) or use www.JuliaBox.com. 

IJulia and JuliaBox allow you to convert the notebooks to jl files ("File-Download As-")
